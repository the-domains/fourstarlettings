  Nerja is right on the coast at the foothills of the Sierra De Tejada mountains.
  A location where luckily the mass tourism that exists elsewhere on the coast
  never really took hold. A great mix of local and foreign holiday makers keep
  Nerja real. Great selection of restaurants, shops and bars. Plenty to do and to
  see locally and further afield.



  On the Mediterranean with a long tourism history. The Costa del Sol has
  something for everyone. From sun soaked beaches to seasonal ski resorts. From
  stunning natural vistas to some of the best night life in Europe.



  Malaga city is a great place to visit. Beautiful promenades and stunning parks.
  Great shopping and plenty of Museums.



  Water parks, theme parks, zoos and casinos are just some of the tourist
  attractions on the Costa.
